<description>Multi-agent orchestration command for flexible task execution (sequential/parallel) with user approval gates</description>
</meta>
<purpose>Coordinates flexible agent execution (sequential by default, parallel when beneficial) with approval checkpoints and comprehensive vector memory integration. Agents communicate through vector memory for knowledge continuity. Accepts $ARGUMENTS task description. Zero distractions, atomic tasks only, strict plan adherence.</purpose>
<iron_rules>
<rule id="zero-distractions" severity="critical">
<text>ZERO distractions - implement ONLY specified task from $ARGUMENTS. NO creative additions, NO unapproved features, NO scope creep.</text>

</rule>
<rule id="approval-gates-mandatory" severity="critical">
